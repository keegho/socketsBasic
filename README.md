# socketsBasic Chat App
Author: Kegham Karsian

This is a simple chat app using socket.io

Install nodejs

npm install to install dependencies

node server.js and start listening to server on localhost:3000

Enter name & room name: 
Depending on the room you are in tell your friends to check in the same room too so you would chat together in group.

If no room name was entered you will be in the main chat room.

lastly i have added a alert sound feature using ion-sound to alert you even if you are not on the same website tab.
